answer = "IMPORTANT: Please review your HOA or master policy agreement with your condo association to know what you are responsible for in the event of an accident. If an accident occurs and your common area is destroyed, your association may impose a loss assessment that requires all the owners to pay a deductible on the master policy.\n\nCondo insurance provides coverage for your personal property. You have two options to select from for coverage ACV (Actual Cash Value) or replacement cost. It is advised to elect to choose the replacement cost option because it insures your personal property at full value without the account of depreciation.\n\nWe have a range of loss assessments that can be offered, be sure to review your HOA or master policy to ensure you have proper loss assessment coverage\n\nCondo Insurance also covers any liability brought upon you or your family by a third party.
